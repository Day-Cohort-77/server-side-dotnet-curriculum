# Book 5 - Server-Side Rendering with ASP.NET MVC
Congratulations, You've made it to book 5!  
In this book you will learn a little bit about server-side rendering and the ASP.NET MVC framework.  

Hold your horses...What is server-side rendering? You may be thinking.  Let's discuss.  We'll start by addressing the term "server-side". A server refers to a computer somewhere on the Internet, so when we say server-side, we're simply describing that it's happening on a computer somewhere on the Internet.  What about "redering"? In the context of a web application we use the word "render" to refer to the process of dynamically generating HTML using some programming language. MVC, which stands for Model View Controller, is a popular pattern for server-side rendering applications. ASP.NET Core MVC is a popular framework used to build server-side rendering applications.

An alternative to server-side rendering is client-side rendering. In the front end course, you were used to building applications as react clients that would make fetch calls out to web APIs request data in the form of JSON. This pattern of a JavaScript client application communicating with a Server API is sometimes called "Fullstack", sometimes "Client/Server" and sometimes "client-side rendering". This is a popular pattern for making web applications, but it's certainly not the only one.
