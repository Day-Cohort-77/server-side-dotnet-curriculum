# Server-Side C# and .NET Curriculum

Welcome to the Server-Side C# and .NET curriculum! This repository contains a comprehensive curriculum for learning server-side development using C#, .NET, SQL, and related technologies.

## Curriculum Overview

This curriculum is designed to take you from the basics of C# programming to building complex web applications and APIs. It's organized into books—with multiple projects per book—each focusing on specific aspects of server-side development:

1. **Book 1: C# and SQL Foundations** - Learn the fundamentals of C#, SQL, and building your first Web API.
2. **Book 2: Entity Framework** - Learn how to simplify database operations are performed with C# code, rather than with SQL. Learn how authentication works. Learn how integration tests work.
3. **Book 3: Capstone Projects** - Apply all the skills you've learned in capstone projects.

## Learning Approach

This curriculum follows a project-based learning approach. Each book contains multiple projects that you'll build from scratch, applying the concepts you learn along the way. The projects increase in complexity as you progress through the curriculum, allowing you to gradually build your skills and confidence.

Key features of this curriculum:

- **Hands-on Projects**: Learn by building real-world applications
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Clear, detailed instructions for each project
- **Conceptual Explanations**: Understand the "why" behind the code
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple concepts and gradually tackle more complex topics

## Development Environment

This curriculum is designed to be completed using:

- **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor
- **.NET SDK 8.0** or later for C# development
- **PostgreSQL** for database management
- **VSCOde SQLTools extension** for viewing, and managing, your database

Installation instructions for these tools are provided in Book 1.

## Project Structure

Each book is organized into chapters, with each chapter focusing on a specific concept or part of a project. The chapters include:

- Learning objectives
- Conceptual explanations
- Code examples
- Step-by-step instructions
- Practice exercises

The code for each project is built incrementally across multiple chapters, allowing you to see how the project evolves over time.
