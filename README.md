# Server-Side C# and .NET Curriculum

Welcome to the Server-Side C# and .NET curriculum! This repository contains a comprehensive curriculum for learning server-side development using C#, .NET, SQL, and related technologies.

## Curriculum Overview

This curriculum is designed to take you from the basics of C# programming to building complex web applications and APIs using ASP.NET Core. It's organized into multiple books, each focusing on specific aspects of server-side development:

1. **Book 1: C# and SQL Foundations** - Learn the fundamentals of C#, object-oriented programming, and database interactions with SQL and Entity Framework Core.
2. **Book 2: Web APIs** - Build RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.
3. **Book 3: SQL and Entity Framework Core** - Dive deeper into SQL and Entity Framework Core for data access and management.
4. **Book 4: Controllers and MVC** - Learn about ASP.NET Core MVC and more advanced controller concepts.
5. **Book 5: MVC** - Focus on the Model-View-Controller pattern in ASP.NET Core.
6. **Book 6: Capstone Projects** - Apply all the skills you've learned in capstone projects.

For a detailed breakdown of each book and its chapters, see the [TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md](./TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md) file.

## Learning Approach

This curriculum follows a project-based learning approach. Each book contains multiple projects that you'll build from scratch, applying the concepts you learn along the way. The projects increase in complexity as you progress through the curriculum, allowing you to gradually build your skills and confidence.

Key features of this curriculum:

- **Hands-on Projects**: Learn by building real-world applications
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Clear, detailed instructions for each project
- **Conceptual Explanations**: Understand the "why" behind the code
- **Practice Exercises**: Reinforce your learning with additional exercises
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple concepts and gradually tackle more complex topics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

1. A basic understanding of programming concepts
2. Visual Studio Code installed
3. .NET SDK 8.0 or later installed
4. PostgreSQL installed

If you're new to programming, we recommend starting with an introductory programming course before diving into this curriculum.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the required software (see the installation chapters in Book 1)
3. Start with Book 1 and work through the chapters in order
4. Complete the projects and exercises in each chapter
5. Move on to the next book when you're ready

## Development Environment

This curriculum is designed to be completed using:

- **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor
- **.NET SDK 8.0** or later for C# development
- **PostgreSQL** for database management
- **pgAdmin** for interacting with PostgreSQL databases

Installation instructions for these tools are provided in the first chapters of Book 1.

## Project Structure

Each book is organized into chapters, with each chapter focusing on a specific concept or part of a project. The chapters include:

- Learning objectives
- Conceptual explanations
- Code examples
- Step-by-step instructions
- Practice exercises

The code for each project is built incrementally across multiple chapters, allowing you to see how the project evolves over time.
