# Entity Framework Core

In this section of the course, you'll learn how to use Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to interact with a SQL database. EF Core is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that allows .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need to write most of the data-access code.

## Installations

Before you start work on the projects in this section, you need to complete all of the [installations](./chapters/book-2-installs.md). Once done, come back to this page and start on the first project.

## Creek River Campground API

In this project, you'll build an API for the Creek River Campground reservation system. You'll use Entity Framework Core to create and interact with a PostgreSQL database.

## Additional Projects

After completing the Creek River Campground API, you can explore these additional projects to further enhance your understanding of Entity Framework Core:

| Project | Description |
|--|--|
| [Hillary's Hair Care](./chapters/hillarys-project-requirements.md) | Build an API for a hair salon with many-to-many relationships |
| [Loncotes County Public Library](./chapters/loncotes-setup.md) | Build an API for a library with complex queries and AutoMapper |
| [Honey Rae's Repair Shop](./chapters/honey-rae-database.md) | Build an API for a repair shop with repositories and cascade delete |

## ü§î Learning Reflections

Once you have completed the projects, your job is to do a self-assessment. This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned so far.

| # | | Description |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | [Coding Assessment](./chapters/book-3-coding-assessment.md) | In this assessment, we will be testing your understanding of Entity Framework Core and SQL concepts covered in this book. |
