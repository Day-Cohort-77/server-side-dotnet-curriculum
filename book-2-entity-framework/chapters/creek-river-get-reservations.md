# Chapter to GET reservations which introduces LINQ methods ThenInclude

In this chapter, we'll create an API endpoint to retrieve reservations from our database using Entity Framework Core. We'll learn how to include related data from multiple levels of relationships using the `Include` and `ThenInclude` methods.

## Understanding Related Data in Entity Framework Core

One of the powerful features of Entity Framework Core is its ability to load related data along with the primary entities you're querying. This is similar to performing JOINs in SQL, but with a more object-oriented approach.

EF Core provides several methods for loading related data:

1. **Eager Loading**: Loading related data along with the primary entities in the same query using the `Include` and `ThenInclude` methods.
2. **Explicit Loading**: Loading related data explicitly after the primary entities have been loaded.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Loading related data automatically when the navigation property is accessed.

In this chapter, we'll focus on eager loading using `Include` and `ThenInclude`.

## Understanding Include and ThenInclude

The `Include` method is used to specify related entities to include in the query results. For example, when querying reservations, you might want to include the related campsite and user profile.

The `ThenInclude` method is used to specify additional related entities to include from the included entities. For example, after including the campsite, you might want to include the campsite type.

## Creating the GET Endpoint for Reservations

Let's create an endpoint to retrieve all reservations with their related data:

1. Open the `Program.cs` file.

2. Add the following endpoint after the existing endpoints:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/reservations", (CreekRiverDbContext db) =>
{
    return db.Reservations
        .Include(r => r.UserProfile)
        .Include(r => r.Campsite)
        .ThenInclude(c => c.CampsiteType)
        .OrderBy(res => res.CheckinDate)
        .ToList();
});
```

Let's break down this code:

- `app.MapGet("/reservations", ...)`: This maps HTTP GET requests to the `/reservations` URL to our handler function.

- `(CreekRiverDbContext db) => { ... }`: This is the handler function. The `CreekRiverDbContext` parameter is injected by ASP.NET Core's dependency injection system.

- `db.Reservations`: This accesses the `Reservations` DbSet in our DbContext, which represents the `Reservations` table in the database.

- `.Include(r => r.UserProfile)`: This tells EF Core to include the related `UserProfile` entity for each reservation. This is similar to a LEFT JOIN in SQL.

- `.Include(r => r.Campsite)`: This tells EF Core to include the related `Campsite` entity for each reservation.

- `.ThenInclude(c => c.CampsiteType)`: This tells EF Core to include the related `CampsiteType` entity for each campsite. This is where we start to see the power of `ThenInclude`: it allows us to include entities that are related to the entities we've already included.

- `.OrderBy(res => res.CheckinDate)`: This orders the results by the check-in date.

- `.ToList()`: This executes the query and returns all reservations as a list, including their related data.

## Understanding the Generated SQL Query

The LINQ query in our endpoint is translated into a SQL query by Entity Framework Core. The generated SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT r.Id, r.CampsiteId, r.UserProfileId, r.CheckinDate, r.CheckoutDate,
       up.Id, up.FirstName, up.LastName, up.Email,
       c.Id, c.Nickname, c.ImageUrl, c.CampsiteTypeId,
       ct.Id, ct.CampsiteTypeName, ct.MaxReservationDays, ct.FeePerNight
FROM Reservations r
LEFT JOIN UserProfiles up ON r.UserProfileId = up.Id
LEFT JOIN Campsites c ON r.CampsiteId = c.Id
LEFT JOIN CampsiteTypes ct ON c.CampsiteTypeId = ct.Id
ORDER BY r.CheckinDate
```

This SQL query joins the `Reservations` table with the `UserProfiles`, `Campsites`, and `CampsiteTypes` tables, and selects all the columns from these tables.

## Testing the Endpoint

Now that we've created our endpoint, let's test it:

1. Run the application with `dotnet run` or by pressing F5 in Visual Studio.

2. Use a web browser or a tool like Yaak to send a GET request to `https://localhost:<port>/reservations`.

3. You should see a JSON response with the reservations and their related data.

## Understanding the Response

The response from our endpoint will be a JSON array of reservation objects, each with its related user profile, campsite, and campsite type:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "campsiteId": 1,
    "userProfileId": 1,
    "checkinDate": "2023-06-10T00:00:00",
    "checkoutDate": "2023-06-13T00:00:00",
    "userProfile": {
      "id": 1,
      "firstName": "Admina",
      "lastName": "Strator",
      "email": "admina@creekriver.campground",
      "reservations": []
    },
    "campsite": {
      "id": 1,
      "nickname": "Barred Owl",
      "imageUrl": "https://tnstateparks.com/assets/images/content-images/campgrounds/249/colsp-area2-site73.jpg",
      "campsiteTypeId": 1,
      "campsiteType": {
        "id": 1,
        "campsiteTypeName": "Tent",
        "maxReservationDays": 7,
        "feePerNight": 15.99,
        "campsites": []
      },
      "reservations": []
    }
  },
  // More reservations...
]
```

## Handling Circular References

You might notice that the JSON response contains empty arrays for the `reservations` property of the `userProfile` and `campsite` objects, and for the `campsites` property of the `campsiteType` object. This is because these are navigation properties that create circular references in the object graph.

A circular reference occurs when objects reference each other in a way that creates a loop: a reservation includes a campsite, which includes reservations, which include campsites, and so on.

Entity Framework Core can handle circular references in the entity model, but when serializing to JSON, we need to be careful to avoid infinite loops. There are several ways to handle this:

1. **Configure JSON serialization to ignore circular references**: ASP.NET Core can be configured to ignore circular references during JSON serialization. This can be done by adding the following code to the `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<JsonOptions>(options =>
{
    options.SerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler = ReferenceHandler.IgnoreCycles;
});
```

This is the approach we're using in our project. With this configuration, the JSON serializer will detect circular references and represent them as empty arrays or null values, depending on the property type.

2. **Use System.Text.Json's `[JsonIgnore]` attribute**: You can use the `[JsonIgnore]` attribute to exclude properties from JSON serialization:

```csharp
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public class Campsite
{
    // Other properties...

    [JsonIgnore]
    public List<Reservation> Reservations { get; set; }
}
```

## Adding Filtering and Pagination

In a real-world application, you might want to add filtering and pagination to your endpoint to limit the number of results and improve performance. Here's how you might modify the endpoint to support filtering by date range and pagination:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/reservations", (CreekRiverDbContext db, DateTime? startDate, DateTime? endDate, int? page, int? pageSize) =>
{
    IQueryable<Reservation> query = db.Reservations
        .Include(r => r.UserProfile)
        .Include(r => r.Campsite)
        .ThenInclude(c => c.CampsiteType);

    // Filter by date range if provided
    if (startDate.HasValue)
    {
        query = query.Where(r => r.CheckinDate >= startDate.Value);
    }

    if (endDate.HasValue)
    {
        query = query.Where(r => r.CheckoutDate <= endDate.Value);
    }

    // Order by check-in date
    query = query.OrderBy(r => r.CheckinDate);

    // Apply pagination if provided
    if (page.HasValue && pageSize.HasValue)
    {
        query = query.Skip((page.Value - 1) * pageSize.Value).Take(pageSize.Value);
    }

    return query.ToList();
});
```

This code adds optional parameters for filtering by date range and pagination, and modifies the query based on these parameters.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we've created an API endpoint to retrieve reservations with their related data using Entity Framework Core. We've learned how to:

1. Use the `Include` method to include related entities in the query results
2. Use the `ThenInclude` method to include additional related entities from the included entities
3. Configure JSON serialization to handle circular references
4. Handle circular references in the entity model
5. Add filtering and pagination to the endpoint

These concepts are fundamental to creating efficient and flexible APIs with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

In the next chapter, we'll create an endpoint to create a new reservation.
