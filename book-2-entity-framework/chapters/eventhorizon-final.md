# Final Requirements

## Feature Description

In this final chapter, you'll ensure that your API meets all requirements and follows best practices. This includes proper error handling, consistent responses, and handling edge cases.

## Requirements

- Ensure all endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - 200 OK for successful GET, PUT, and PATCH requests
  - 201 Created for successful POST requests that create resources
  - 204 No Content for successful DELETE requests
  - 400 Bad Request for invalid input data
  - 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints
  - 403 Forbidden for authenticated but unauthorized requests
  - 404 Not Found for resources that don't exist
  - 409 Conflict for requests that conflict with the current state
  - 500 Internal Server Error for server-side errors

- Implement consistent error handling:
  - Create a standardized error response format
  - Include meaningful error messages
  - Include validation errors when appropriate
  - Log errors on the server side

- Handle edge cases gracefully:
  - Empty result sets
  - Invalid input formats
  - Concurrent updates
  - Resource conflicts

- Ensure the API is well-documented:
  - Consider adding Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
  - Include clear descriptions for all endpoints
  - Document request and response formats

- Implement appropriate validation:
  - Validate all input data
  - Return clear validation error messages
  - Prevent invalid data from being saved to the database

## Reflection

Consider testing various scenarios to ensure the API behaves as expected. Try to think of edge cases that might cause problems, such as trying to register for an event that's already at capacity, or trying to update an event that has already occurred. A robust API should handle these cases gracefully and provide clear feedback to the client.

Congratulations on completing the EventHorizon project! You've built a comprehensive event planning API using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. This project has covered many important concepts, including:

- Entity Framework Core
- Data modeling and relationships
- API design and implementation
- Authentication and authorization
- Advanced queries and filtering

These skills will be valuable as you continue your journey as a .NET developer.
