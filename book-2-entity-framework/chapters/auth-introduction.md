# Introduction to Authentication and Authorization

In this chapter, we'll introduce the concepts of authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core applications. We'll also discuss how we'll organize our authentication endpoints using a clean, maintainable approach.

## Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Before we dive into the implementation, let's clarify the difference between authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying who a user is. It answers the question, "Who are you?"
- **Authorization** is the process of verifying what a user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What can you do?"

In a typical web application, authentication happens first (the user logs in), and then authorization happens for each request (the application checks if the user has permission to access a resource).

## ASP.NET Core Identity

ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET Core apps. It provides:

- User authentication
- Password hashing and validation
- User data storage
- Role-based authorization
- External login providers (like Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication

We'll use ASP.NET Core Identity to implement authentication and authorization in our application.

## Organizing Authentication Endpoints

In our approach, we'll organize our authentication endpoints in a separate file, following the pattern of separating endpoints by functionality. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Better organization** - Authentication endpoints are grouped together, making them easier to find and modify.
2. **Improved maintainability** - The `Program.cs` file remains clean and focused on configuration.
3. **Scalability** - As your application grows, you can add new endpoint classes without cluttering `Program.cs`.
4. **Testability** - Endpoint classes can be tested independently.

Here's how we'll structure our project:

```
TinyTreats/
├── Endpoints/
│   ├── AuthEndpoints.cs
│   ├── RoleEndpoints.cs
│   └── OrderEndpoints.cs
├── Models/
│   ├── UserProfile.cs
│   └── Order.cs
├── Data/
│   └── TinyTreatsDbContext.cs
├── Program.cs
└── ...
```

In this structure:
- `AuthEndpoints.cs` will contain all authentication-related endpoints (register, login, logout, etc.)
- `RoleEndpoints.cs` will contain all role management endpoints
- `OrderEndpoints.cs` will contain all order-related endpoints

Each of these files will define an extension method that maps the endpoints to the application. For example:

```csharp
// Endpoints/AuthEndpoints.cs
public static class AuthEndpoints
{
    public static void MapAuthEndpoints(this WebApplication app)
    {
        // Define authentication endpoints here
    }
}
```

Then, in `Program.cs`, we'll call these extension methods:

```csharp
// Program.cs
app.MapAuthEndpoints();
app.MapRoleEndpoints();
app.MapOrderEndpoints();
```

This approach keeps our code clean, maintainable, and scalable.

## What We'll Build

In the following chapters, we'll build a simple bakery management system called "TinyTreats" with the following features:

1. **User Registration and Login** - Users can register and log in to the application.
2. **Role-Based Authorization** - Different users have different roles (Admin, Baker, Customer) with different permissions.
3. **Order Management** - Users can create orders, and staff can manage them.

We'll implement these features using ASP.NET Core Identity and Minimal API, with a focus on clean, maintainable code organization.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll set up our project and implement user registration and login functionality.
