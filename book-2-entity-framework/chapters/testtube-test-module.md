- Learn how to write effective test methods

## What is a Test Module?

In the context of our TestTube project, a test module is a class that contains related test methods. Each test module typically focuses on testing a specific component or feature of the application. In our case, we have two test modules:

1. `EquipmentTests.cs`: Contains tests for the equipment endpoints
2. `ScientistTests.cs`: Contains tests for the scientist endpoints

Let's examine the structure of a test module to understand how it's organized.

## Test Module Structure

Open the `EquipmentTests.cs` file in the TestTubes.Tests project. You'll see something like this:

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http.Json;
using TestTubes.API.Models;
using Xunit;

namespace TestTubes.Tests;

public class EquipmentTests
{
    private readonly TestHelper _testHelper;

    public EquipmentTests()
    {
        _testHelper = new TestHelper();
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task GetAllEquipment_ReturnsAllEquipment()
    {
        // Arrange
        var client = _testHelper.Client;

        // Act
        var response = await client.GetAsync("/equipment");
        var equipment = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<Equipment>>();

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
        Assert.Equal(4, equipment.Count);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task GetEquipmentById_ReturnsCorrectEquipment()
    {
        // This test needs to be implemented
    }

    // More test methods...
}
```

Let's break down the key components of this test module:

### Namespace and Class Declaration

The test module is defined as a class within the `TestTubes.Tests` namespace. The class name typically reflects what's being tested, in this case, `EquipmentTests`.

### Fields and Constructor

The test module has a private field for the TestHelper and a constructor that initializes it:

```csharp
private readonly TestHelper _testHelper;

public EquipmentTests()
{
    _testHelper = new TestHelper();
}
```

This ensures that each test method has access to the TestHelper, which provides the HTTP client and sets up the test environment.

### Test Methods

The test module contains one or more test methods, each annotated with the `[Fact]` attribute:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetAllEquipment_ReturnsAllEquipment()
{
    // Test implementation...
}
```

Each test method tests a specific aspect of the application's behavior. The method name typically follows the pattern `MethodName_ExpectedBehavior`, which makes it clear what's being tested and what the expected outcome is.

## The Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

Most test methods follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern, which divides the test into three distinct phases:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the test environment and prepare the inputs
2. **Act**: Perform the action being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify that the action produced the expected result

Let's look at an example:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetAllEquipment_ReturnsAllEquipment()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = _testHelper.Client;

    // Act
    var response = await client.GetAsync("/equipment");
    var equipment = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<Equipment>>();

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
    Assert.Equal(4, equipment.Count);
}
```

In this example:
- **Arrange**: We get the HTTP client from the TestHelper
- **Act**: We make a GET request to the equipment endpoint and deserialize the response
- **Assert**: We verify that the response has a 200 OK status code and contains 4 equipment items

The AAA pattern makes tests easier to read and understand, as it clearly separates the setup, the action, and the verification.

## Test Method Naming

Good test method names are crucial for understanding what's being tested. A common naming convention is:

```
MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior
```

For example:
- `GetAllEquipment_ReturnsAllEquipment`: Tests that the GetAllEquipment method returns all equipment
- `GetEquipmentById_WithValidId_ReturnsCorrectEquipment`: Tests that the GetEquipmentById method returns the correct equipment when given a valid ID
- `GetEquipmentById_WithInvalidId_ReturnsNotFound`: Tests that the GetEquipmentById method returns a 404 Not Found when given an invalid ID

Clear and descriptive test method names serve as documentation for your code and make it easier to understand what's being tested.

## Test Method Implementation

Let's look at a complete test method implementation:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetEquipmentById_WithValidId_ReturnsCorrectEquipment()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = _testHelper.Client;
    var expectedId = 1;
    var expectedName = "Microscope";

    // Act
    var response = await client.GetAsync($"/equipment/{expectedId}");
    var equipment = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<Equipment>();

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
    Assert.Equal(expectedId, equipment.Id);
    Assert.Equal(expectedName, equipment.Name);
}
```

This test:
1. Arranges the test by getting the HTTP client and defining the expected values
2. Acts by making a GET request to the equipment endpoint with a specific ID
3. Asserts that the response has a 200 OK status code and that the returned equipment has the expected ID and name

## Test Methods to Implement

In the TestTube project, you'll need to implement two test methods:

1. `GetEquipmentById_ReturnsCorrectEquipment` in the EquipmentTests class
2. `GetAllScientists_ReturnsAllScientists` in the ScientistTests class

These methods are already defined but have empty implementations. Your task will be to fill in these implementations following the patterns you've learned.

## Next Steps

Now that we understand the structure of a test module, let's implement the equipment tests.
