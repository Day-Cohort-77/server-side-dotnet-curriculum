# Creating the first endpoint that will GET campsites

In this chapter, we'll create our first API endpoint using Entity Framework Core to retrieve campsite data from our database. We'll implement two endpoints: one to get all campsites and another to get a specific campsite by its ID.

## Understanding API Endpoints with EF Core

In minimal APIs, endpoints are defined directly in the `Program.cs` file using methods like `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, and `MapDelete`. These methods map HTTP requests to handler functions that process the request and return a response.

When using Entity Framework Core with these endpoints, we can inject the `DbContext` into the handler function to access the database.

## Getting All Campsites

Let's start by creating an endpoint to get all campsites:

1. Open the `Program.cs` file.

2. Add the following endpoint after the middleware configuration (after `app.UseHttpsRedirection();`):

```csharp
app.MapGet("/api/campsites", (CreekRiverDbContext db) =>
{
    return db.Campsites.ToList();
});
```

Let's break down this code:

- `app.MapGet("/api/campsites", ...)`: This maps HTTP GET requests to the `/api/campsites` URL to our handler function.

- `(CreekRiverDbContext db) => { ... }`: This is the handler function. The `CreekRiverDbContext` parameter is injected by ASP.NET Core's dependency injection system.

- `db.Campsites`: This accesses the `Campsites` DbSet in our DbContext, which represents the `Campsites` table in the database.

- `db.Campsites.ToList()`: This executes the query and returns all campsites as a list.

- `.ToList()`: This executes the query and returns the results as a list.

## Understanding LINQ and Entity Framework

The query in our endpoint uses LINQ (Language Integrated Query), which is a set of features in C# that provides a consistent syntax for querying different types of data sources.

When used with Entity Framework Core, LINQ queries are translated into SQL queries that are executed against the database. For example, the query in our endpoint might be translated to something like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Campsites"
```

This is a powerful feature of Entity Framework Core: it allows you to write queries in C# that are translated to SQL at runtime.

## Getting a Specific Campsite by ID

Now, let's create an endpoint to get a specific campsite by its ID:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/api/campsites/{id}", (CreekRiverDbContext db, int id) =>
{
    return db.Campsites
        .Include(c => c.CampsiteType)
        .Single(c => c.Id == id);
});
```

This endpoint is similar to the previous one, but with a few key differences:

- `"/api/campsites/{id}"`: This URL pattern includes a parameter `{id}` that captures the ID from the URL.

- `(CreekRiverDbContext db, int id) => { ... }`: The handler function now takes an additional `id` parameter, which is bound to the `{id}` parameter in the URL.

- `.Include(c => c.CampsiteType)`: This tells EF Core to include the related `CampsiteType` entity in the query. This is similar to a JOIN in SQL.

- `.Single(c => c.Id == id)`: This filters the results to the campsite with the specified ID. `Single` will throw an exception if no matching campsite is found or if more than one matching campsite is found.

## Adding Error Handling

The `Single` method will throw an exception if no matching campsite is found. Let's add error handling to return a 404 Not Found response instead:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/api/campsites/{id}", (CreekRiverDbContext db, int id) =>
{
    try
    {
        return db.Campsites
            .Include(c => c.CampsiteType)
            .Single(c => c.Id == id);
    }
    catch (InvalidOperationException)
    {
        return Results.NotFound();
    }
});
```

Alternatively, we can use `SingleOrDefault` and check for null:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/api/campsites/{id}", (CreekRiverDbContext db, int id) =>
{
    var campsite = db.Campsites
        .Include(c => c.CampsiteType)
        .SingleOrDefault(c => c.Id == id);

    if (campsite == null)
    {
        return Results.NotFound();
    }

    return Results.Ok(campsite);
});
```

## Testing the Endpoints

Now that we've created our endpoints, let's test them:

1. Run the application with `dotnet run` or by pressing F5 in Visual Studio.

2. Open a web browser or a tool like Yaak and navigate to:
   - `https://localhost:<port>/api/campsites` to get all campsites
   - `https://localhost:<port>/api/campsites/1` to get the campsite with ID 1

3. You should see JSON responses with the campsite data.

## Understanding the Results

When you call the `/api/campsites` endpoint, you should see a JSON array of campsite objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "nickname": "Barred Owl",
    "imageUrl": "https://tnstateparks.com/assets/images/content-images/campgrounds/249/colsp-area2-site73.jpg",
    "campsiteTypeId": 1,
    "campsiteType": null,
    "reservations": []
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "nickname": "Red Fox",
    "imageUrl": "https://tnstateparks.com/assets/images/content-images/campgrounds/249/colsp-area2-site73.jpg",
    "campsiteTypeId": 2,
    "campsiteType": null,
    "reservations": []
  },
  // More campsites...
]
```

When you call the `/api/campsites/{id}` endpoint, you should see a single campsite object with its related campsite type:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "nickname": "Barred Owl",
  "imageUrl": "https://tnstateparks.com/assets/images/content-images/campgrounds/249/colsp-area2-site73.jpg",
  "campsiteTypeId": 1,
  "campsiteType": {
    "id": 1,
    "campsiteTypeName": "Tent",
    "maxReservationDays": 7,
    "feePerNight": 15.99
  },
  "reservations": []
}
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we've created our first API endpoints using Entity Framework Core to retrieve campsite data from our database. We've learned how to:

1. Create an endpoint to get all campsites
2. Create an endpoint to get a specific campsite by ID
3. Include related data in our queries
4. Handle errors and return appropriate HTTP responses

These endpoints demonstrate the power of Entity Framework Core: we can write simple, expressive queries in C# that are translated to SQL at runtime, and we can easily include related data in our queries.

In the next chapter, we'll create an endpoint to add a new campsite to the database.
