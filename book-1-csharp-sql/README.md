# Introduction to C# and API Servers

## Installations

Before you start work on the project in this course, you need to complete all of the [installations](./chapters/book-1-installations.md). Once done, come back to this page and start on the first project.

## Projects

You need to complete all of columns in 2 weeks. You want to be working on the final two columns for the majority of week 2 since they are most cognitively challenging.

## ü§î Learning Reflections

Once you have completed the project, your job is to do a self-assessment. This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned so far.

| #   |  | Description |
| --- | ------------------ | --- |
| 1   | [Vocabulary Interview][30] | In this interview, we will be discussing your understanding and vocabulary on the technical concepts covered in this book to ensure you are prepared for the group project. |

## üîê Group Project

Once everyone has had their reflections interview with a coach, we will start on a major group project that will span multiple Sprints.

| # | Project&nbsp;Name | Description |
|--|--|--|
|1| [Rare Publishing Platform][31] | Your first, large full-stack group project. You will be building an API service with Python, and using SQL to manage the permanent state in your database. |

## ü§î Final Reflections

| #   |  | Description |
| --- | ------------------ | --- |
| 1   | [Proficiency Interview][32] | We will be interviewing each team after the group project is complete to discuss your growth on general problem solving skills and help you devise strategies for growth. |
