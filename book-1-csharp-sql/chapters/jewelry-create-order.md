# Create New Order

In this chapter, we'll implement the endpoint for creating a new order in our Jewelry Junction API. This will involve more complex operations like transactions, validation, and updating related data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Implement a POST endpoint to create a new order
- Validate the order data before processing
- Use transactions to ensure data consistency
- Update related data (product stock quantities)
- Handle errors and edge cases
- Return appropriate responses

## Understanding the Order Creation Process

Creating an order is a complex operation that involves several steps:
1. Validating the order data (customer exists, products exist, sufficient stock, etc.)
2. Creating the order record
3. Creating order item records for each product in the order
4. Updating product stock quantities
5. Calculating the total order amount
6. Returning the created order with its items

Since these operations need to be atomic (all succeed or all fail), we'll use a transaction to ensure data consistency.

## Implementing the Endpoint

For our order creation endpoint, we'll implement a POST request handler at the "/orders" route. This endpoint will:

1. Define a route handler for POST /orders
2. Parse the request body to extract order information
3. Validate the order data
4. Begin a database transaction
5. Create the order and order items
6. Update product stock quantities
7. Calculate the total order amount
8. Commit the transaction if all operations succeed
9. Return the created order with its details
10. Roll back the transaction if any operation fails

The implementation will use the DatabaseService to execute the necessary SQL commands within a transaction.

## Validating Order Data

Before processing an order, we need to validate the data to ensure it's complete and valid:

1. Verify that the customer exists by querying the customers table
2. Check that the order contains at least one item
3. Verify that each product exists by querying the products table
4. Check that there's sufficient stock for each product
5. Validate that quantities are positive

This validation helps prevent invalid orders from being processed and provides clear error messages to clients.

## Using Transactions

To ensure data consistency, we'll use a database transaction that encompasses all the operations involved in creating an order:

1. Begin a transaction using BEGIN TRANSACTION
2. Execute all SQL commands (INSERT, UPDATE) within the transaction
3. Commit the transaction using COMMIT if all commands succeed
4. Roll back the transaction using ROLLBACK if any command fails

This approach ensures that either all parts of the order creation succeed, or none of them do, preventing partial updates that could leave the database in an inconsistent state.

## Creating the Order and Order Items

The core of our implementation will:

1. Insert a new record into the orders table with customer ID, order date, and initial status
2. Retrieve the generated order ID
3. For each item in the order:
   - Calculate the unit price (considering any active discounts)
   - Insert a record into the order_items table
   - Update the product's stock quantity

These operations will be performed using parameterized SQL commands to prevent SQL injection.

## Calculating the Total Amount

To calculate the total order amount:

1. Sum the (unit price Ã— quantity) for each order item
2. Update the total_amount column in the orders table with this sum

This calculation ensures that the order total accurately reflects the prices at the time of purchase, including any applicable discounts.

## Handling Edge Cases

Our implementation will handle various edge cases:

1. Products with insufficient stock
2. Invalid product IDs
3. Invalid customer ID
4. Empty order (no items)
5. Database errors during transaction

For each case, we'll provide appropriate error responses with clear messages to help clients understand what went wrong.

## Formatting the Response

After successfully creating an order, we'll format a comprehensive response that includes:

1. Basic order information (ID, date, status, total amount)
2. Customer information
3. Detailed information about each order item:
   - Product details (name, type, metal, category)
   - Pricing information (original price, discount amount, unit price)
   - Quantity and subtotal
4. Summary information (item count, creation timestamp)

This detailed response provides clients with all the information they need to display an order confirmation.

## Implementing Request Validation

To make our API more robust, we'll implement request validation:

1. Define a clear request structure that clients must follow
2. Validate that all required fields are present
3. Check that data types are correct
4. Validate business rules (e.g., quantities must be positive)

This validation happens before any database operations, preventing invalid requests from affecting the database.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, you've learned how to implement the endpoint for creating a new order in the Jewelry Junction API. You've used transactions to ensure data consistency, validated the order data before processing, updated related data, and handled errors and edge cases. You've also learned how to structure the response to provide useful information to clients.

In the next chapter, we'll implement the endpoint for deleting an order, which will involve similar concepts like transactions and validation.

## Practice Exercise

Enhance your Create Order endpoint by:
1. Adding validation for the quantity (must be positive)
2. Adding support for applying a discount code to the entire order
3. Adding support for shipping information (address, shipping method, etc.)
4. Implementing inventory reservation (temporarily reserve inventory during checkout)
5. Adding support for payment information (payment method, transaction ID, etc.)
