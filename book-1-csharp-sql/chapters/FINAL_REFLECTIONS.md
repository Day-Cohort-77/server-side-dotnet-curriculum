# Final Reflections on C# and SQL

On the last day of the project, you will review the following questions and record, individually, the observations you have and your current understanding of each topic. Once everyone on the team is finished documenting their responses to the questions, you will review them collaboratively.

On the following Monday, an instructor will join your team before you start the next round of individual learning and answer questions, provide expert guidance and context that you may have about any topic.

## Data Types

1. Can I explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#?
2. Can I explain what nullable types are and when to use them?

## Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

1. What is the purpose of a class in object-oriented programming?
2. Can I explain the difference between a class and an object (instance)?
3. Can I explain what access modifiers (public, private, protected) are and when to use each?
4. What are constructors and why are they important?

## Methods

1. Am I able to define and call methods in C#?
2. Do I understand the concepts of method parameters, return types, and method overloading?
3. Can I explain the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference?

### Exception Handling

1. Can I explain the purpose of try/catch/finally blocks in C#?
2. Do I understand when and how to throw exceptions?

### SQL and Databases

1. Can I explain what SQL is and why it is used in software development?
2. Am I able to write basic SQL queries to select, insert, update, and delete records?
3. Can I construct SQL queries to join tables and retrieve related data?
4. Do I understand the concept of primary and foreign keys in relational databases?

## Collaboration

- What high-value service(s) are you providing to your team and your customers when reviewing a teammate's code?
- Why do merge conflicts happen? Can, or should, they be prevented? When should they be resolved?
- When you make a commitment for a sprint, what should the team discuss to make sure the tickets are worked on in the right order to ensure that work isn't blocked?

## Full Stack Development

- Imagine that you are given a new feature to build for the Jewelry Shop API, for example adding a new endpoint to search for products by price range. What is the technical process for implementing that feature? What should be done first, and what should be done last?
- Do you feel that basic operations such as filtering data, joining related data, and ordering data were done by the database (SQL), your C# code, or both?
- As a software developer, can you describe what the purpose of an HTTP request is in the context of a Minimal API?
- When deciding on the route names to support in your Minimal API, what strategy should you follow? Is there a pattern that you have identified?

## Data

- Can you store flat or nested data in a PostgreSQL database?
- Can you represent flat or nested data in a JSON request/response in your Minimal API?
- In the Jewelry Shop project:
  - How did you connect to the PostgreSQL database from your C# application?
  - What role does the Npgsql library play in your application?
  - What is the difference between using parameterized SQL queries versus string concatenation?

## Patterns and Strategies

- When reviewing a teammate's code, identify some reasons why the code, while it may be working, would need to be removed, changed, moved, etc? Can you think of an example from the Extravert or Jewelry Shop project?
- What are the benefits of using a Minimal API approach for building web services?
- How did you organize your code in the Jewelry Shop API to maintain separation of concerns?
- How did you handle data validation in your Minimal API endpoints?

## C# and Object-Oriented Programming Reflections

- How does C#'s strong typing system help prevent errors in your code? What advantages or challenges did you encounter?
- What was your experience working with collections (Lists, Dictionaries) in C#? How do they compare to arrays?
- How did you implement inheritance and interfaces in the Extravert project? What benefits did they provide?
- What strategies did you use for handling errors and exceptions in your C# console application?
- How did you model relationships between classes in your Extravert project?
