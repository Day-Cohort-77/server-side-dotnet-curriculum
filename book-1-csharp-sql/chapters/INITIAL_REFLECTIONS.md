# Book 1 Reflections

This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned in this project and collect your thoughts on the following questions. Part of becoming a high-value software developer is understanding key concepts... not just the ability to pattern match and write code.

When you are done reflecting on these topics and feel that you have a solid understanding of each one, reach out to an instructor for a vocabulary review to ensure you are prepared for technical interviews.

## What You Should Know

We will not be discussing these questions during the interview, because we expect you to have this knowledge. It is your job to ensure that you have the understanding and vocabulary for them.

### Conditionals

1. Can I explain the difference between `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements in C#?
2. Do I understand the difference between `==` and `.Equals()` when comparing values?
3. Am I familiar with the ternary operator (`condition ? trueResult : falseResult`) and when to use it?
4. How would I check if a dictionary contains a specific key in C#?

### Loops

1. Can I write a `for` loop to iterate through elements in an array or list?
2. Do I understand how to use `foreach` loops and when they are more appropriate than standard `for` loops?
3. Can I explain the difference between `while` and `do-while` loops?
4. Am I able to use `break` and `continue` statements effectively within loops?

### Data Types

1. Can I explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#?
2. Do I understand when to use `int` versus `double` versus `decimal` for numeric values?
3. Can I explain what nullable types are and when to use them?

### Functions and Methods

1. Am I able to define and call methods in C#?
2. Do I understand the concepts of method parameters, return types, and method overloading?
3. Can I explain the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference?
4. Am I familiar with expression-bodied methods and when to use them?

## Concepts and Vocabulary We Will Discuss

These questions will be discussed during our interview, but we will not review the actual code.

### Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

1. What is the purpose of a class in object-oriented programming?
2. Can I explain the difference between a class and an object (instance)?
3. Do I understand the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism?
4. What is the difference between fields and properties in C#?
5. Can I explain what access modifiers (public, private, protected) are and when to use each?
6. What are constructors and why are they important?

### Interfaces and Inheritance

1. Can I explain what an interface is and why it's useful in C#?
2. Do I understand the difference between implementing an interface and inheriting from a class?
3. Can I explain what method overriding is and how to use the `override` keyword?

### Exception Handling

1. Can I explain the purpose of try/catch/finally blocks in C#?
2. Do I understand when and how to throw exceptions?
3. Am I familiar with common exception types in C# and when they occur?
4. Can I explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?

### SQL and Databases

1. Can I explain what SQL is and why it is used in software development?
2. Am I able to write basic SQL queries to select, insert, update, and delete records?
3. Can I construct SQL queries to join tables and retrieve related data?
4. Do I understand the concept of primary and foreign keys in relational databases?
5. Am I familiar with the different types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)?
6. Can I explain what database normalization is and why it's important?

## Code Review

These questions will be part of a code review, so you will be asked to share your screen.

### Collections

1. Can I create, modify, and access elements in a C# List?
2. Do I understand how to use dictionaries in C# and when they are appropriate?
3. Can I explain the difference between arrays and Lists in C#?
4. Am I familiar with LINQ and how to use it to query collections?

### DateTime

1. Can I explain how to work with dates and times in C#?
2. Do I understand how to format dates for display?
3. Am I familiar with common DateTime operations (adding/subtracting time, comparing dates)?
4. Can I explain the difference between local time and UTC?

### Minimal APIs

1. Can I explain what a minimal API is in the context of ASP.NET Core?
